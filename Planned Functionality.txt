Needs to be done:
- Writing memory values without access violations
- Removing SteamAPI logs from the debug console window, as they are redundant
- Automatic update checker before the game launches, which checks the AppVeyor for a new update, and then asks if they want to update before launching the game. 

Finished:

- Game running in a new thread, so running sleep functions won't freeze the rest of the process
- Grabbing the in-game resolution from the in-game executable and calculating a new field of view
- Reading from config files
- Reading memory values (Although array of byte values are still having a little bit of trouble with access violations)
- Getting the Module Handle
