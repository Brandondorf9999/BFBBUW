Needs to be done:

- Automatic update checker before the game launches, which checks the AppVeyor for a new update, and then asks if they want to update before launching the game.
- Reading from config files (So then a custom FPS cap option and custom FOV can be implemented)
- Custom FOV option (Which is based around a 16:9 Vert- Aspect Ratio), that compensates based on aspect ratio
- Code refactoring 

Finished:

- Writing memory values without access violations
- Game running in a new thread, so running sleep functions won't freeze the rest of the process
- Grabbing the in-game resolution from the in-game executable and calculating a new field of view
- Reading memory values
- Getting the Module Handle
