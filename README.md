# 21xMachi9 (Daemon X Machina Ultrawide Fix)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4337wbguqe28173v/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BesuBaru/21xMachi9/branch/master)

## About
An ASI Loader plugin which allows Daemon X Machina to run on Ultrawide displays, and with even higher framerates.

## Compiling (For programmers)
1. Download Visual Studio 2019
2. Open this repository in GitHub desktop to clone the repo.
3. Open [21xMachi9.sln](21xMachi9.sln) in Visual Studio, make sure the build setting is set to Release Win64, then compile. 
4. The compiled ASI plugin should be in the plugins folder contained in **"Binaries\Win64"**.

## Setup
Copy the plugins folder and dsound.dll (ASI Loader) into the **"\DXM\Binaries\Win64\"** directory of where the game is installed.

*Note: If you don't have any other Steam library locations set up, this will likely be **"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\DaemonXMachina"**.*

## Download (For novices)
[Latest version can be downloaded here.](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/6cac65g6m3f20yiw/artifacts/Binaries%2F21xMachi9_Win64_Build-Release.zip
)
Development has just begun, so most functionality is missing.

ASI Loader is not included at the moment, but including it with the download is planned.
